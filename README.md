# Measles-vaccination-coverage-scenarios
This Github repository contains the code used to run age-stratified, metapopulation compartmental models using odin.dust with different scenarios for vaccination uptake. These models are used to analyse the dynamics of measles outbreaks in England between 2010 and 2019, and to simulate changes in vaccination coverage between 2010 and 2019. The generated simulations can me found in the models Output/models folder, figures are saved in the in the Figures folder and summary tables are saved in the Output folder.
